# Match3Dimensional
<h2>What's that supposed to mean?!</h2>
<p>3Connect3Dimensional is currently the project-name of my Match three puzzle VR-game, programmed in Unity.</p>

<h2>What's so special about it</h2>
<p>It isn't only your everyday Match-three-puzzle, because it's played in VR, which means <strong>YOU</strong> can move around. 
But that's not all either, after all why should yoou be able to move around if there is no need too, therefore I added some <strong>depth</strong> to the game 
and with that the Game just got a lot bigger. With the third axis, to make lines of three or more, the possibilities of combinations is more and more complicated, 
but also the chance to make more points skyrocketed.

<h2>Why do I do this?</h2>
<p>After graduating the college <a href="https://www.spengergasse.at/">HTL Spengergasse</a> informatics-branch, I knew I wanted to develop video-games. 
At around 2019 I got myself into VR and was fascinated. So I started to play around first and only played them, but now im going to change the sides. </br>
Therefore I started to play around in Unity and finaly came to this.</p>
